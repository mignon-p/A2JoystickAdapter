# Apple II Joystick Adapter

This small board lets you plug a 16-pin joystick into the external
9-pin joystick port on the Apple IIe.  Although the Apple IIe has an
internal 16-pin joystick port, I found that the connector on my
joystick was too big to fit through any of the holes on the back of
the IIe.  So, I created this adapter to let me plug it in externally.

This adapter could also be useful for the Apple IIc, which does not
have a 16-pin joystick port at all, although I have not tested it on a
IIc.
